		// this function edits the variable resultText, which refers to the paragraph titled "results" located on page 5. 
		// the page updates to reflect the results aka relative percentages of each diagnosis type
		/**
		in-depth explanation of this function:
		
		originally, there is a paragraph on the results page called "results" that is completely empty.
		it is empty because we don't have any results at first.
		as the user answers the questions, the data gets collected in the two counter variables for allergy and cold.
		by the time the user reaches the results page, all the data has been collected. now results can be calculated.
		clicking the button "show results" on the results page will call a function called resultsPercentages(). 
		This function takes the collected data from the counters and calculates the results. 
		In this program, it calculates what percentage of answers refers to each diagnosis.
		once these results have been calculated, the function prints the results into the previously empty paragraph.
		the way it does this is by directly editing the content of the paragraph. 
		as a result, once the button "Show Results" has been pressed, the user will be able to see their percentages appear under the button.
